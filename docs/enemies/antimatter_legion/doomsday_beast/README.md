description: Using fragments of the Dusk Leviathan as foundation and the wails of the countless remnants within the Warforge as the agent, the Antimatter Legion cast many Doomsday Beasts. The resentful spirits' senseless obsession turns into a tangible hand, and the destructive shadows of old condense into a tail that covers the heavens. The will of the multitudes not content with their demise are locked within the Doomsday Beasts. Anger, mourning, or delusional joy â€” all is revealed, and all evil begins to move. The Doomsday Beast's core is a dark matter engine.
