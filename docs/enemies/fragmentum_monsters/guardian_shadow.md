  A shadow manifested by the power of a Stellaron, carrying out the Fragmentum's unceasing will to expand.
  A living being of energy born from the projection of the desires of sentient lifeforms into the Fragmentum, akin to a pearl created from a single grain of sand. This energy wanders around aimlessly, acting only when executing the will of its master.
